Hi!

This is a project which is implemented with JAVA and JAX-RS. Also, it has the frontend which include JAVASCRIPT in it. The frontend shows how the CRUD interact with the
system through GUI and the backend shows how the CRUD functions are happening inside the system connecting with the MySQL workbench server.
